      <h1>Citadel of Aleppo</h1>
      <p> Is a large medieval fortified palace in the centre of the old city of
        Aleppo, northern Syria. It is considered to be one of the oldest and
        largest castles in the world. Usage of the Citadel hill dates back at
        least to the middle of the 3rd millennium BC. Subsequently occupied by
        many civilizations including the Greeks, Byzantines, Ayyubids and
        Mamluks, the majority of the construction as it stands today is thought
        to originate from the Ayyubid period.</p>
